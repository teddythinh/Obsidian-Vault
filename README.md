## Notes
~~I use some community plugins and themes, so if you want to use it like me, you may import from the `.obsidian` folder.~~

I use the `.gitignore` file recommendation from [Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/06+Tips-and-Tricks) so it hides my `.obsidian` folder.

You **MUST** clone my repository and run it in the Obsidian Vault to able to see images in all of the `.md` files.
